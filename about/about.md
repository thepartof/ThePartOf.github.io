I've used to be a non-tech oriented student in school. I wasn't even very sure about what to do at the time of graduation.


But apparently I need to get a job somehow because I did not want my parent to feed me anymore. I applied for sales, 
marketing, programming, even HR, and I got 2 offers from sales and programming. I decided to choose programming job 
because I thought it was somehow a hard-core skill and might help me in future though I just knew simple java at then. 

But work is work, you need to get it done no matter you know how or not. I had to search a lot and read a lot and learn 
a lot. And surprisingly I felt I kind of liked learning new things, as well as the feeling that getting a challenging 
things done using new technique. This kind of satisfactory nothing could replace I think.

Now I know what I wanted to do. I want to learn new things and do things that will never keep me in a safe zone. And I 
like programming, it keeps me focusing and I love the process of creating. I can feel that I am being updated by new 
things and cool stuff every time I know a bit more. 

And now I'm a bit more confident than I was in school, because I learned all these new things by myself and I was able to 
build something using stuff I learned, like this blog (though it needs a lot improvements). This ignites my passion! 
So I figured I might be able to do something even cooler and more challenging. 

I will be more than please to be contact at: wuzijian522@gmail.com
    
    
Thanks for your time!
