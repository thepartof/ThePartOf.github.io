This is an amazing keyboard for me!

I promise you will start to love typing simply because you just can't get enough of the feel when you touch the keys.

I'm not sure if you accept the little noises it makes when you type, but for people who loves the blue switch like me, will definitely enjoy this "click" sound when typing!

Even though you don't like the sound, that "mechanical" feeling still makes typing a very cool thing.

Anyways, just buy it or at least give a try! You won't regret!
