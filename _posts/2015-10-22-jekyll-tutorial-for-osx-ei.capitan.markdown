Before installation, you need to make sure your `usr/local/bin` is in you $PATH, if not, execute the following command in you terminal:
{% highlight ruby %}
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin
{% endhighlight %}

And to avoid any sort of this access issue, when you install `jekyll`, use `sudo` command like:
{% highlight ruby %}
$  sudo gem install jekyll
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you might encounter this problem when you tried to install jekyll:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo gem install jekyll
...
...
...
Building native extensions. This could take a while...
ERROR: Error installing jekyll:
ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension.
{% endhighlight %}

To solve this issue, you need the command line tools, simple enter `GCC` in the terminal, and it will pop up a alert for you to install that command line tools:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ gcc
{% endhighlight %}

Now, congrats! You are done with the installation. And next, follow the documents on the jekyll website to create your own blog!
{% highlight ruby %}
$ mkdir MyBlog                   //create a folder for your site
$ cd Myblog                      //point to the folder where you want to put the files
$ jekyll new                     //command to ask jekyll to build a blog 
$ jekyll serve --watch           //now go to localhost:4000 and see what happened, --watch allows the auto-generation to your browser
{% endhighlight %}
